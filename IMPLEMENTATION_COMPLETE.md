### 2. Forecasting Algorithms

#### Time Series Models

**Moving Average**:
```
forecast = (sum of last N periods) / N
```
- Best for: Daily and weekly forecasts
- Window size: 7 periods (configurable)
- Use case: Stable demand patterns

**Exponential Smoothing**:
```
forecast = α * actual + (1 - α) * previous_forecast
```
- Best for: Hourly forecasts
- Alpha (α): 0.3 (configurable)
- Use case: Short-term predictions with recent data emphasis

**Weighted Moving Average**:
```
forecast = Σ(weight_i * value_i) / Σ(weights)
```
- Best for: Weekly forecasts
- Weights: Recent periods weighted higher
- Use case: Trend-following predictions

**Seasonal Decomposition**:
```
forecast = trend + seasonal + residual
```
- Best for: Monthly forecasts
- Seasonality: 7-day cycle (weekly patterns)
- Use case: Long-term planning with seasonal patterns

#### Confidence Intervals

**95% Confidence Interval**:
```
CI = σ * 1.96
where σ = sqrt(variance)
```
- Calculates upper and lower bounds
- Used for risk assessment
- Helps identify forecast uncertainty

---

### 3. Labor Capacity Planning

#### Worker Assignment Algorithm

**Greedy Assignment**:
1. Sort workers by skill level (descending)
2. Calculate required workers per category
3. For each worker:
   - Find category with highest need
   - Check worker capability
   - Assign to optimal shift
   - Decrease requirement count

**Shift Optimization**:
- Distribute workers evenly across shifts
- Consider shift premiums
- Balance workload across day/evening/night
- Account for worker availability

**Productivity Calculations**:
```
Effective Rate = Standard Rate * Skill Multiplier
Output = Effective Rate * Hours Worked
Required Workers = Volume / (Productivity Rate * Shift Hours)
```

#### Capacity Metrics

**Utilization Percentage**:
```
Utilization = (Required Labor Hours / Available Labor Hours) * 100%
```

**Balance Classification**:
- **Understaffed**: < 85% utilization
- **Optimal**: 85% - 110% utilization
- **Overstaffed**: > 110% utilization

**Labor Cost Estimation**:
```
Cost = Hours * Hourly Rate * Shift Premium
```

---

### 4. Workload Optimization

#### Optimization Goals
1. Minimize labor cost
2. Maximize utilization (target: 90-100%)
3. Balance workload across shifts
4. Match skills to tasks
5. Respect worker constraints (max hours, availability)

#### Constraint Handling
- Worker max hours per week
- Skill requirements per category
- Shift coverage requirements
- Cost budget limits
- Service level agreements

#### Recommendations Engine

**Analyzes**:
- Staffing levels (understaffed/overstaffed)
- Forecast accuracy
- Shift balance
- Cost optimization opportunities

**Provides**:
- Actionable recommendations
- Quantified impact (worker count, cost)
- Priority ranking
- Risk assessment

## Usage Examples

### 1. Generate Demand Forecast

```java
// Historical data (last 7 days of picking volumes)
Map<WorkloadCategory, List<Integer>> historical = Map.of(
    WorkloadCategory.PICKING, List.of(1200, 1150, 1300, 1250, 1180, 1220, 1240)
);

DemandForecast forecast = workloadPlanningService.generateDemandForecast(
    "WH-001",
    ForecastPeriod.DAILY,
    LocalDateTime.now().plusDays(1),
    historical
);

// Result: Forecasted picking volume = 1220 (7-day moving average)
```

### 2. Create Workload Plan

```java
WorkloadPlan plan = workloadPlanningService.createWorkloadPlan(
    "WH-001",
    LocalDate.now().plusDays(1),
    forecast
);

// Plan created with volumes from forecast
// Status: DRAFT
```

### 3. Optimize Labor Allocation

```java
List<WorkerCapacity> workers = List.of(
    new WorkerCapacity("W001", "John Doe", SkillLevel.SENIOR, 40, true, 25.0),
    new WorkerCapacity("W002", "Jane Smith", SkillLevel.EXPERT, 40, true, 30.0),
    new WorkerCapacity("W003", "Bob Johnson", SkillLevel.INTERMEDIATE, 32, false, 20.0)
);

WorkloadPlan optimized = workloadPlanningService.optimizeLaborAllocation(
    plan.getPlanId(),
    workers
);

// Workers assigned to shifts
// Utilization calculated
// Cost estimated
```

### 4. Get Recommendations

```java
WorkloadRecommendations recs = workloadPlanningService.getRecommendations(
    "WH-001",
    LocalDate.now().plusDays(1)
);

// Example output:
// - "OPTIMAL: Utilization at 93.8%. Plan is well-balanced."
// - "FORECAST ACCURACY: Current accuracy 92.5%. Within acceptable range."
```
